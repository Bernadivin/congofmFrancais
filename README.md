==> Termes et conditions Conditions :

En téléchargeant ou en utilisant l'application CONGO FM, ces conditions s'appliqueront automatiquement à vous – vous devez donc vous assurer de les lire attentivement avant d'utiliser l'application. Vous n'êtes pas autorisé à copier ou à modifier l'application, toute partie de l'application ou nos marques déposées de quelque manière que ce soit. Vous n’êtes pas autorisé à tenter d’extraire le code source de l’application, et vous ne devez pas non plus essayer de traduire l’application dans d’autres langues ou de créer des versions dérivées. L'application elle-même, ainsi que toutes les marques, droits d'auteur, droits de base de données et autres droits de propriété intellectuelle qui y sont liés, appartiennent toujours à BeroSat.Tech.

BeroSat.Tech s'engage à garantir que l'application soit aussi utile et efficace que possible. Pour cette raison, nous nous réservons le droit d'apporter des modifications à l'application ou de facturer ses services, à tout moment et pour quelque raison que ce soit. Nous ne vous facturerons jamais l’application ou ses services sans vous indiquer très clairement ce que vous payez. Il est de votre responsabilité de sécuriser votre téléphone et votre accès à l’application.

Nous vous recommandons donc de ne pas jailbreaker ou rooter votre téléphone, qui est le processus de suppression des restrictions logicielles et des limitations imposées par le système d'exploitation officiel de votre appareil. Cela pourrait rendre votre téléphone vulnérable aux logiciels malveillants/virus/programmes malveillants, compromettre les fonctionnalités de sécurité de votre téléphone et cela pourrait signifier que l'application CONGO FM ne fonctionnera pas correctement ou pas du tout.

L'application utilise des services tiers qui déclarent leurs conditions générales.

You should be aware that there are certain things that BeroSat.Tech will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but BeroSat.Tech cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app. Along the same lines, BeroSat.Tech cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, BeroSat.Tech cannot accept responsibility. With respect to BeroSat.Tech’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. BeroSat.Tech accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point, we may wish to update the app.

The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. BeroSat.Tech does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
